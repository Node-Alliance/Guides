Withdrawn stakes will be returned to your wallet address in approximately 48 hours. In the "Stakes" section of your Theta wallet, you'll now see the stake's Withdrawn status has been changed to "Yes" and there is a projected "Return Height" which is the block at which your stake will be available in your wallet address.
